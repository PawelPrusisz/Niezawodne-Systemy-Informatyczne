multi.adb:14:22: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when AA = 65533 and AB = 2147418115) [possible explanation: loop invariant at line 18 should mention AB][#0]
multi.adb:18:32: medium: loop invariant might not be preserved by an arbitrary iteration, cannot prove AA < A * B (e.g. when A = 2 and AA = 2 and B = 1)[#1]
multi.adb:18:32: medium: loop invariant might fail in first iteration, cannot prove AA < A * B (e.g. when A = 0 and AA = 0 and B = 1)[#2]
multi.ads:6:16: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Mult'Result = A * B (e.g. when A = 1 and B = 2 and Mult'Result = 0)[#3]
